Hi! I am Kyle Reese and I am interested in statistics, applied mathematics, and computer science and their applications in insurance, finance, and biology. I currently work at Westfield Insurance where I am responsible for personal lines data needs. 

I am currently constructing this website and making this my main page (older page was https://kyle-jeffrey-reese.github.io/personal-website/
). The things on the navbar do have some placeholder information in them but this website is obviously not a finished project! Some of the things I am working on include:

* Academic papers I have written
* Projects I have created (including Shiny, Streamlit, and Dash apps)
* Programming website solutions (Kattis, Project Euler, Project Rosalind, etc.)
* Code to reference for future use
