Hi! I am Kyle Reese and I am interested in statistics, applied mathematics, and computer science and their applications in insurance, finance, and biology. I currently work at Tokio Marine HCC as the Senior Data Scientist for the Public Risk Group (we insure water districts (both private and public) as well as municipalities like townships, cities, fire and police departments, counties, etc.).

I use this website to catalog code, keep track of notes and research papers, blog, and a wide variety of other things. Obviously feel free to explore!
